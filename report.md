## Complications
I actually only encountered one complication during the implementation of the assignment, which was how to display both sensor meaurements (temperature and humidity) in a line chart in Adafruit. I had to change the feed I had created, wich was combined for both temperature and humidity data, into two seperate feeds that I subsequently grouped together. In that way I was able to send data to two feeds in one mqtt publish message. Other than that there were no complications. The lectures were very helpful and instructive, and I managed to solder the headers to the pico w board properly.
